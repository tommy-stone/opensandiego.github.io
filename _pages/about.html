        <h3 class="display-4">Our History</h2>
        <p>Open San Diego's roots lead back to 2009, when founder Jed Sundwall attended a Sunlight Foundation Transparency Camp, and where he was encouraged by Code for America founder Jen Pahlka to use his development of social media strategies for sites like <a href="https://www.usa.gov/" target="_blank">USA.gov</a> locally in San Diego.</p>

        <p>Sundwall initially focused Open San Diego as an open data library for the city of San Diego. “The thesis is that we want to give developers, researchers, journalists, policy makers and bureaucrats easy access to data that accurately describes the city so they can do their jobs more easily.”</p>

        <p>"We want to make the case that this isn’t just about transparency, but that sharing data can make lawmakers’ and public servants’ jobs easier while improving the quality of policy and service delivery," Sundwall said. "It’s a win-win."</p>

        <p>Since that time Open San Diego has morphed into it's current form as an official <a href="https://brigade.codeforamerica.org" target="_blank">Brigade of Code for America</a>.</p>
